            Ask the crowd, how many people were stuck on something this week? How many of you were a little upset - scared/worried while you were stuck? How many of you then criticized yourself for being stuck? Use this to go to next point which is shared experiences & unrealistic expectations on reality.

              - Name same tools/languages/frameworks. - We look at things we don't know and feel that that makes us unefficient developer - Touch on the fact that this is especially strong feeling in our field given the fast-paced environment. -This is a dangerous way of thinking because this only reinforces our expectations on reality, and makes us afraid to try new things in case we fail at them. -This is also reaaallly not fair. -We don't think about what we already know clearly. -To make things even more complicated, our field is filled with advancing technologies and there are always these great people that we learn about. - We look at people around us learners of things old and new and think “these guys and girls know what they’re doing.” I “should know what Im doing”</aside>

            So focused on the awesome things he has done/did, didn’t think about the fact that we are both human and that he too faced the fears I face, and had aspirations and looked up to others. Perhaps touch on that I know things this person does not know. And I realized that, he must feel simiarly to how I feel right now. He still has aspirations, has wants to climb more mountains. So in a sense we face the exact same thoughts/feelings – just at different levels. *Find a way to mention things like background, years of experience, strengths and weaknesses. *Emphasise that point* ^
