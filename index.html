          <aside class="notes">
            We all know people at work, school, personal lives, or big names/creators of products/companies. We try to think about what they know and all the greatness they have achieved. By doing so we paint a very false picture. We think the mountain climb was easy for them, and it should be easy for us.

          <h2>Fast-paced field</h2>
          <p>
            Never-ending list of things to learn. “I should know what Im doing”
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            To make things even more complicated, our field is filled with advancing technologies and there are always these great people that we learn about. We look at people around us learners of things old and new and think “these guys and girls know what they’re doing.” I “should know what Im doing”

          <aside class="notes">
            So focused on the awesome things he has done/did, didn’t think about the fact that we are both human and that he too faced the fears I face, and had aspirations and looked up to others. Perhaps touch on that I know things this person does not know.

          <h2>We're not so different after all</h2>
          <p>So in a sense we face the exact same thoughts/feelings – just at different levels.</p>
          <aside class="notes">And I realized that, he must feel simiarly to how I feel right now. He still has aspirations, has wants to climb more mountains. So in a sense we face the exact same thoughts/feelings – just at different levels. *Find a way to mention things like background, years of experience, strengths and weaknesses. *Emphasise that point* ^

          <h2>So why act like we are?</h2>
          <p>If we’re not so different, why are we so supportive of others, critical of ourselves?
