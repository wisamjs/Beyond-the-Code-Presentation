          <ul>
            <li>Fear/unknown is part of the journey. It does not make you a bad developer, it's quite the contrary</li>
            <li>We put others on a pedestal, ourselves in the gutter.</li>
            <li> See others & yourself more accurately. They know things, and they don't know things. They've had truimphs and successes</li>
            <li>You make the rules.</li>
            <li>You are not alone. Everyone goes through these things. We're all human.</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            We have high expectations for ourselves and our minds tend to emphsize the 'solving' part of the word 'prolem-solving'. Focus more on the 'problem' part. Be easy on yourself :)

            Ask the crowd, how many people were stuck on something this week? How many of you were a little upset - scared/worried while you were stuck? How many of you then criticized yourself for being stuck? Use this to go to next point which is shared experiences & unrealistic expectations on reality.

          <h2>#1: A good developer knows/does...</h2>
          <aside class="notes">Name same tools/languages/frameworks. We look at things we don't know and feel that that makes us unefficient developer. Touch on the fact that this is especially strong feeling in our field given the fast-paced environment. This is a dangerous way of thinking because this only reinforces our expectations on reality, and makes us afraid to try new things in case we fail at them. This is also reaaallly not fair. We don't think about what we already know clearly. To make things even more complicated, our field is filled with advancing technologies and there are always these great people that we learn about. We look at people around us learners of things old and new and think “these guys and girls know what they’re doing.” I “should know what Im doing”</aside>

          <aside class="notes">
            We all know people at work, school, personal lives, or big names/creators of products/companies. We try to think about what they know and all the greatness they have achieved. By doing so we paint a very false picture.

            So focused on the awesome things he has done/did, didn’t think about the fact that we are both human and that he too faced the fears I face, and had aspirations and looked up to others. Perhaps touch on that I know things this person does not know.

            And I realized that, he must feel simiarly to how I feel right now. He still has aspirations, has wants to climb more mountains. So in a sense we face the exact same thoughts/feelings – just at different levels. *Find a way to mention things like background, years of experience, strengths and weaknesses. *Emphasise that point* ^
